# Supernaut Webhook Task

A backend mock service for simulating Stripe webhook handling. It listens to Stripe-style events related to subscriptions (created, updated, and deleted) and stores subscription data in a local SQLite database.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Stores subscription events in SQLite.
- Handles creation, update, and deletion of subscriptions.
- Prevents duplicate entries or invalid deletes/updates.
- Exposes an API to list all saved subscriptions.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

- Node.js â‰¥ 14
- npm
- Postman or any HTTP API client

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stripe-subscription-webhook.git
   cd stripe-subscription-webhook

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Start the server:

   npm run dev

   The server will run at:
   http://localhost:3000

## ðŸ“¡ Endpoints

1. POST /webhook
   Accepts Stripe-style webhook events.

   Supported event types:

   - customer.subscription.created
   - customer.subscription.updated
   - customer.subscription.deleted

   Example Payload (send as application/json):

   {
   "type": "customer.subscription.created",
   "data": {
   "object": {
   "id": "sub_123",
   "customer": "cus_456",
   "status": "active",
   "current_period_end": 1735689600
   }
   }
   }

   You can test this using Postman by sending a POST request to:
   http://localhost:3000/webhook

2. GET /subscriptions
   Returns a list of all stored subscriptions.

   Example Response:
   [
   {
   "id": "sub_123",
   "customer_id": "cus_456",
   "status": "active",
   "current_period_end": 1735689600
   }
   ]

## ðŸ§ª Notes

- Subscription `id` is unique.
- `created` events won't add duplicate entries.
- `updated` or `deleted` events are ignored if the subscription does not exist.

## ðŸ›  Database

Uses better-sqlite3. The database file is created automatically on first run.
