# Supernaut Webhook Task

A backend mock service for simulating Stripe webhook handling. It listens to Stripe-style events related to subscriptions (`created`, `updated`, and `deleted`) and stores subscription data in a local SQLite database.

## üì¶ Features

- Stores subscription events in SQLite
- Handles creation, update, and deletion of subscriptions
- Prevents duplicate creation and invalid updates
- Rejects updates that attempt to change `customer_id`
- Returns structured JSON responses with clear success or error messages
- Exposes an API to list all saved subscriptions

## üìå Requirements

- Node.js ‚â• 14
- npm
- Postman or any HTTP API client

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stripe-subscription-webhook.git
   cd stripe-subscription-webhook
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Server will run at:  
   http://localhost:3000

## üì° Endpoints

### 1. POST /webhook

Accepts Stripe-style webhook events. Supported event types:

- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

- **Created**: Indicates a new subscription started, so we add it to our database.
- **Updated**: Reflects any change in subscription status or period end date, ensuring our data stays current.
- **Deleted**: Represents cancellation or removal, so we delete it from our records.

### How are they handled?

- On **created** events, the service inserts a new subscription record. It rejects attempts to create duplicates.
- On **updated** events, the service updates status and period end, verifying the subscription exists and belongs to the same customer.
- On **deleted** events, the service removes the subscription record if it exists.

Each event returns a clear JSON response indicating success or a detailed error message.

**Example Request Payload:**

```json
{
  "type": "customer.subscription.created",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "sub_123",
      "customer": "cus_456",
      "status": "active",
      "current_period_end": 1735689600
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Success Response (create):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "created",
  "subscription_id": "sub_123",
  "status": "active",
  "current_period_end": 1735689600,
  "message": "Created subscription sub_123 (active)"
}
```

**Example Error Response (create duplicate):**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "already_exists",
  "message": "Subscription sub_123 already exists ‚Äî cannot create duplicate"
}
```

**Example Error Response (update non-existing):**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "Subscription sub_999 does not exist ‚Äî cannot update"
}
```

**Example Error Response (customer_id mismatch):**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "customer_id_mismatch",
  "message": "Subscription sub_123 belongs to a different customer ‚Äî update rejected"
}
```

**You can test this using Postman:**

- URL: http://localhost:3000/webhook
- Method: POST
- Headers: Content-Type: application/json
- Body: raw JSON payload (as shown above)

---

### 2. GET /subscriptions

Returns a list of all stored subscriptions.

**Example Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "sub_123",
    "customer_id": "cus_456",
    "status": "active",
    "current_period_end": 1735689600
  }
]
```

### 3. GET /subscriptions/:id

Checks the status of a specific subscription by ID.

### Request:

GET /subscriptions/sub_123

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "subscription_id": "sub_123",
  "customer_id": "cus_456",
  "status": "active",
  "current_period_end": 1735689600,
  "is_active": true,
  "message": "Subscription sub_123 is active"
}
```

**Error Response (Not Found):**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "Subscription sub_999 not found"
}
```

---

## ‚ùó Notes

- Subscription `id` is unique and enforced.
- `created` events strictly insert new subscriptions and fail if the ID already exists.
- `updated` events require the subscription to already exist and match the `customer_id`.
- `deleted` events also require the subscription to exist.
- Clear JSON responses make it easy to debug using Postman or in tests.

## üîç Assumptions & Design Considerations

- **Single source of truth:** Stripe webhook events are treated as the definitive source of subscription status. The backend does not query Stripe APIs but relies solely on incoming events.
- **Idempotency:** Duplicate `created` events for the same subscription ID are rejected to prevent data corruption.
- **Customer ID verification:** Updates that attempt to change the `customer_id` for an existing subscription are rejected to ensure data integrity.
- **Synchronous database operations:** Using `better-sqlite3` for simplicity and speed, with synchronous queries.
- **No authentication:** This mock backend is open and designed for local testing. In production, webhook endpoints should verify signatures and protect against unauthorized access.
- **Limited event types:** Only subscription lifecycle events are handled. Other Stripe event types (e.g., invoices, payments) are out of scope.
- **Simple schema:** The subscription data model stores only essential fields to keep the mock minimalistic.
- **Error handling:** The service returns structured errors to help with debugging during integration or testing.
- **API extension:** The backend exposes endpoints to list all subscriptions and fetch by subscription ID, useful for manual verification or UI integration.
- **No retry logic:** Webhook event retries or failures should be handled by the caller (Stripe) as per their system. This service assumes well-formed incoming requests.
- **No timezone conversions:** Timestamps are stored and returned as Unix epoch integers.

## üõ† Database

- Uses `better-sqlite3` for fast, synchronous access
- Database file `subscriptions.db` is auto-created on first run.
